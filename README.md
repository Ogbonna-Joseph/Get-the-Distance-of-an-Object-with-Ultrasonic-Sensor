# Get-the-Distance-of-an-Object-with-Ultrasonic-Sensor

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine the distance to an object. This sensor reads from 2cm to 400cm (0.8inch to 157inch) with an accuracy of 0.3cm (0.1inches), which is good for most hobbyist projects. In addition, this particular module comes with ultrasonic transmitter and receiver modules.

How Does the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Work?

### The ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine the distance to an object. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- The ultrasound transmitter (trig pin) emits a high-frequency sound (40 kHz).
- The sound travels through the air. If it finds an object, it bounces back to the module.
- The ultrasound receiver (echo pin) receives the reflected sound (echo).
